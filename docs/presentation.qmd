# Capacity of Interest

two observations:
1. a physics [simulation](http://probmods.org/chapters/generative-models.html)
2. a set of [experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-eU5xZW7cU) with children and chimps

how humans:
- ascribe **mental states** (belief, desire, intention; BDI) to self and others
- have a **Theory of Mind** (understanding, model, grasp, notion)

why *theory*?
- mental states are **not** directly **observable**
- **assumption**: behavior is governed by an agent's mental states (BDI cause behavior)
